## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Breaking responsibilites between team members has gone smoothly,

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

None

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We finished most of our tasks this week, we will have to prioritize the baseline features moving forward.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I think the only feature that might be at risk is the upvoting based on user logged in and that is only due to not starting user log in just yet.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I think finalizing who will take charge of each responsibilities will be key in finishing the project how we envision it.
